# pylabianca
Python tools for spike and LFP analysis.

## installation
Currently - just install directly from github (you will need git for that, and of course do it from your terminal/console):
```
pip install git+https://github.com/labianca/pylabianca
```

## docs
Online docs are currently under construction.  
See the [introductory notebook](doc/intro_overview.ipynb) for a general overview using Osort output.  
Another broad overview uses fieldtrip sanoke spike data from non-human primates: [notebook](doc/fieldtrip_example.ipynb)
